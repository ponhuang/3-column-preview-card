## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Learn how to use :nth-child() instead of setting every element with class name.

```css
.cards:nth-child(1) {
  border-radius: 10px 0 0 10px;
  background-color: var(--bright-orange);
}
```
